Project 4: Battleship! on-line
Due: Monday, 28 April
Write client and server code for an on-line version of Battleship
This project tests also you ability to design a protocol
Have a server that keeps track so players can't cheat.
When it is the player's turn, the interaction is client-server.
When the player is waiting, it will wait indefinitely on the server which can cause problems.
Your protocol will have to include abandoning the game, error notifications, start of game notification, etc.
Work in pairs.
This is a fun project; please start early because you will probably have to throw one away.
